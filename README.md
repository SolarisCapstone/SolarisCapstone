# Team Solaris Capstone - Interactive Graduation Planner

## Overview

The **SolarisCapstone Interactive Graduation Planner** is a tool designed to help **UNC Charlotte computer science students** plan their graduation timeline efficiently. Current academic planning tools, such as **DegreeWorks** and **Schedule Wizard**, lack an intuitive interface and fail to provide a seamless way for students to map out their entire degree path. Our project aims to bridge this gap by offering an interactive solution that allows students to:

- Plan their semester-wise course load.
- Ensure prerequisite requirements are met.
- Optimize their graduation timeline based on credit load and summer courses.
- Provide advisors with better visibility into studentsâ€™ academic plans for more effective guidance.

This application will **eliminate the need for manual spreadsheets** and simplify academic planning, making it easier for students to stay on track toward graduation.

## Project Scope

The primary goal of this project is to develop an interactive graduation planner that allows students to **map out their remaining coursework** with a clear, structured approach. The tool will include the following key components:

- **Course Database:** A structured database containing **computer science course requirements** for UNC Charlotte.
- **User Interface:** A student-friendly UI that enables input of completed and planned courses.
- **Prerequisite Verification:** A system that **prevents scheduling conflicts** by ensuring prerequisite rules are followed.
- **Advisor Portal:** A dedicated portal that allows academic advisors to **review student plans** and provide feedback.

By implementing these features, we aim to **streamline course planning, prevent scheduling mistakes, and help students graduate on time** while reducing advisor workload.

## Assumptions

To ensure the functionality and accuracy of the planner, the following assumptions will be made:

- Students will have an accurate understanding of **which courses they have completed** based on their transcript.
- Students using the planner will have already fulfilled or accounted for their **general education requirements**.
- Academic advisors will be familiar with **UNC Charlotteâ€™s course catalog** and provide guidance accordingly.
- The tool will operate under the assumption that **users have access to a compatible device**.
- Students acknowledge that this planner is an **independent project** and not officially integrated with UNC Charlotteâ€™s academic systems.
- The system will **not support direct course registration**, and students must manually enroll in classes through official university portals.

## Constraints

Given the scope and timeframe of the project, the following constraints have been identified:

- The project will be completed **within 16 weeks**, broken into agile sprints for efficient development.
- The planner will be **limited to undergraduate computer science majors**, with no support for interdisciplinary studies, graduate programs, or early entry pathways.
- Only **course requirements from the 2024-2025 academic catalog** will be included, ensuring focus on the most recent curriculum.
- The system will be built specifically for **UNC Charlotte** and will **not support other institutions**.
- The planner will be a **standalone tool** and will not integrate directly with UNC Charlotteâ€™s official databases or systems.
- As we are not officially affiliated with the university, updates to **degree requirements** made by UNC Charlotte **may not be immediately reflected** in our system.

## Technology Stack

To develop the **SolarisCapstone Interactive Graduation Planner**, we will utilize the following technologies:

- **Frontend:** React.js (TBA) / Vue.js (TBA) for an intuitive, interactive user experience
- **Backend:** Node.js (TBA) / Django (TBA) for handling user input and course logic
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (TBA) / Firebase (TBA) for managing course requirements and user plans
- **Authentication:** Firebase/Auth0 (TBA) for secure user login and advisor access
- **Deployment:** Docker & Heroku (TBA) / AWS (TBA) to host the application with containerized scalability
